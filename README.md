# ERA5-Reanalysis
Visualizing ECMWF's ERA5 Reanalysis from both Single and Pressure Levels and on hourly basis, 
at 0.25 x 0.25 degree. These dataset can be queried via NCAR/UCAR RDA (https://rda.ucar.edu/),
direct to THREDDS Server (https://thredds.ucar.edu/thredds/catalog/catalog.html) or conviniently through
CDS (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home)

These notebooks that I created are used for my bachelor's thesis. However, it 
can be used, accordingly based on your preference i.e. location, time, etc. Thus, you can definitely
make improvements out of it.

2. Adjusted gaussian smoothing to most of the NCEP FNL notebooks. 

Minor Tweak(s):
1. Subtle changes to plot titles involving symbols instead of proxy abbreviations. 
2.  Reversed the color scheme in Atmospheric Thickness to accomodate temperature variation.
