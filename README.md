# ERA5-Reanalysis
Visualizing ECMWF's ERA5 Reanalysis from both Single and Pressure Levels and on hourly basis, 
at 0.25 x 0.25 degree. These dataset can be queried via NCAR/UCAR RDA (https://rda.ucar.edu/),
direct to THREDDS Server (https://thredds.ucar.edu/thredds/catalog/catalog.html) or conviniently through
CDS (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home).

These notebooks that I created are used for my bachelor's thesis. However, it 
can be used, accordingly based on your preference i.e. location, time, etc. Thus, you can definitely
make improvements out of it.
